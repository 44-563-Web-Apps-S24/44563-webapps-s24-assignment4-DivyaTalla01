    <h1>Divya Talla does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h2>The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov</h2>
        
    <p>
     
        
        IVANOFF is sitting at a table reading.
        
        BORKIN, in top-boots and carrying a gun, comes in from the rear of the
        garden. He is a little tipsy. As he sees IVANOFF he comes toward him on
        tiptoe, and when he comes opposite him he stops and points the gun at
        his face.
        
        IVANOFF. [Catches sight of BORKIN. Shudders and jumps to his feet]
        Misha! What are you doing? You frightened me! I can't stand your stupid
        jokes when I am so nervous as this. And having frightened me, you laugh!
        [He sits down.]
        
        BORKIN. [Laughing loudly] There, I am sorry, really. I won't do it
        again. Indeed I won't. [Take off his cap] How hot it is! Just think, my
        dear boy, I have covered twelve miles in the last three hours. I am worn
        out. Just feel how my heart is beating.
        
        
        IVANOFF. [Goes on reading] Oh, very well. I shall feel it later!
        
        BORKIN. No, feel it now. [He takes IVANOFF'S hand and presses it against
        his breast] Can you feel it thumping? That means that it is weak and
        that I may die suddenly at any moment. Would you be sorry if I died?
        
        IVANOFF. I am reading now. I shall attend to you later.
        
        BORKIN. No, seriously, would you be sorry if I died? Nicholas, would you
        be sorry if I died?
        
        IVANOFF. Leave me alone!
        
        BORKIN. Come, tell me if you would be sorry or not.
        
        IVANOFF. I am sorry that you smell so of vodka, Misha, it is disgusting.
        
        BORKIN. Do I smell of vodka? How strange! And yet, it is not so strange
        after all. I met the magistrate on the road, and I must admit that we
        did drink about eight glasses together. Strictly speaking, of course,
        drinking is very harmful. Listen, it is harmful, isn't it? Is it? Is it?
        
        IVANOFF. This is unendurable! Let me warn you, Misha, that you are going
        too far.
        
        BORKIN. Well, well, excuse me. Sit here by yourself then, for heaven's
        sake, if it amuses you. [Gets up and goes away] What extraordinary
        people one meets in the world. They won't even allow themselves to be
        spoken to. [He comes back] Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. Please let me have
        eighty-two roubles.
