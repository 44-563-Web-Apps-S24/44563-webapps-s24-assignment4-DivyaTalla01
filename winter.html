        MAIN CHARACTER
        ACT I  
    
    </p>

    <p class="direction">
        The garden of IVANOFF'S country place. On the left is a terrace and the
        facade of the house. One window is open. Below the terrace is a broad
        semicircular lawn, from which paths lead to right and left into a
        garden. On the right are several garden benches and tables. A lamp is
        burning on one of the tables. It is evening. As the curtain rises sounds
        of the piano and violoncello are heard.
    </p>

    <p class="speech main-character">
        IVANOFF is sitting at a table reading.
    </p>

    <p class="speech main-character">
    
        [BORKIN, in top-boots and carrying a gun, comes in from the rear of the
        garden. He is a little tipsy. As he sees IVANOFF he comes toward him on
        tiptoe, and when he comes opposite him he stops and points the gun at
        his face.]
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> [Catches sight of BORKIN. Shudders and jumps to his feet]
        Misha! What are you doing? You frightened me! I can't stand your stupid
        jokes when I am so nervous as this. And having frightened me, you laugh!
        [He sits down.]
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> [Laughing loudly] There, I am sorry, really. I won't do it
        again. Indeed I won't. [Take off his cap] How hot it is! Just think, my
        dear boy, I have covered twelve miles in the last three hours. I am worn
        out. Just feel how my heart is beating.
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> [Goes on reading] Oh, very well. I shall feel it later!
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> No, feel it now. [He takes IVANOFF'S hand and presses it against
        his breast] Can you feel it thumping? That means that it is weak and
        that I may die suddenly at any moment. Would you be sorry if I died?
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> I am reading now. I shall attend to you later.
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> No, seriously, would you be sorry if I died? Nicholas, would you
        be sorry if I died?
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> Leave me alone!
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> Come, tell me if you would be sorry or not.
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> I am sorry that you smell so of vodka, Misha, it is disgusting.
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> Do I smell of vodka? How strange! And yet, it is not so strange
        after all. I met the magistrate on the road, and I must admit that we
        did drink about eight glasses together. Strictly speaking, of course,
        drinking is very harmful. Listen, it is harmful, isn't it? Is it? Is it?
    </p>
    <p class="speech ivanoff">
        <strong>IVANOFF:</strong> This is unendurable! Let me warn you, Misha, that you are going
        too far.
    </p>
    <p class="speech borkin">
        <strong>BORKIN:</strong> Well, well, excuse me. Sit here by yourself then, for heaven's
        sake, if it amuses you. [Gets up and goes away] What extraordinary
        people one meets in the world. They won't even allow themselves to be
        spoken to. [He comes back] Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. Please let me have
        eighty-two roubles.
